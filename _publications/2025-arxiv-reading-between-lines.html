Evaluating developer satisfaction with conversational AI assistants at scale is critical but challenging. User studies provide rich insights, but are unscalable, while large-scale quantitative signals from logs or in-product ratings are often too shallow or sparse to be reliable. This paper proposes using sentiment analysis of developer prompts to identify implicit signals of user satisfaction, based on an analysis of industrial usage logs from 372 professional developers.
