This research examines how developers use machine-readable directives to provide project context to AI coding assistants. Through analysis of 401 open-source repositories, the authors created a taxonomy organizing essential project context into five themes: Conventions, Guidelines, Project Information, LLM Directives, and Examples. The study explores how this contextual information varies across different project types and programming languages.
