## Prospective Students

Thank you for your interest! I'm glad we share the same goal and vision of making programming more accessible, enjoyable, and productive through AI.

I am looking for motivated students interested in designing, building, and evaluating AI tools that make programming more accessible and effective for developers at all levels. 

Ideal candidates have strong programming skills and research experience in Software Engineering, Natural Language Processing, and/or Human-Computer Interaction. However, if you have a strong interest in both technical systems and human factors, and curiosity about how developers work and how AI can help them, I encourage you to apply regardless of your background.

### How to Get Involved

**Prospective PhD students:** Apply to UCI's PhD programs in Informatics or Software Engineering.

**Current UCI PhD students:** Interested in collaboration? Email me at [daye.nam@uci.edu](mailto:daye.nam@uci.edu) - let's talk!

**UCI Master's and undergraduate students:** Email me your CV, transcript, and a **brief** description of your research interests.

### A Note on Email
You're welcome to email with questions or to express interest, but I may not be able to reply to every message. [This FAQ by Yonatan Bisk](https://talkingtorobots.com/FAQ.html) provides helpful context about faculty email practices.
