# Hi, I'm Daye Nam

<div class="intro" markdown="1">
My research focuses on designing, building, and evaluating AI tools for programmers at all levels, with a strong emphasis on making these tools useful and usable. My ultimate goal is to create a future where building software is more accessible, efficient, and enjoyable for everyone, while ensuring programmers still stay in control. To do so, I work at the intersection of software engineering, AI, and human-computer interaction.

I received my PhD from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) in May 2024, where I was advised by [Brad Myers](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/), [Bogdan Vasilescu](https://bvasiles.github.io/), and [Vincent Hellendoorn](https://vhellendoorn.github.io/). I also received my MS from [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) and BS from [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/).

Prior to starting at UC Irvine, I worked at [Google](https://about.google/) as a Research Scientist analyzing and enhancing internal AI-powered developer tools, and previously as an intern at [Google](https://about.google/) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/). Details are in my [CV]({{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}).
